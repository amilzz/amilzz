The point of this file is to set up a well demultiplex of inline barcode RAD data.

# Organization notes
I have made a .gitignore file that contains:    

```{sh}
head .gitignore
```

Anyting put in data, outputs, bams or ends with .html won't be synced via github.     



## Data Location    

`/home/amilzz/projects/LCT/BMAG072/raw2/lane3`
`/home/amilzz/projects/LCT/BMAG072/raw2/lane4`

Expect to work the best: /home/amilzz/projects/LCT/BMAG072/raw2/lane3/LibPlate10_WWH2_R1.fastq

I'll set up on FARM like so:
